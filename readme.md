# Flower Image Classification API

This project provides a simple API for classifying flower images using a TensorFlow Lite model.  It's built with FastAPI for the API and uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to predict the type of flower in an image given its URL.

## Project Structure
. ├── BACKEND.py # Contains the image prediction logic using TensorFlow Lite. ├── main.py # FastAPI application that exposes the prediction endpoint. ├── model.tflite # (Assumed) The TensorFlow Lite model file. └── README.md # This file.


## Requirements

*   Python 3.7+
*   TensorFlow
*   FastAPI
*   Uvicorn (for running the API)
*   `numpy`
*   `keras`

Install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow fastapi uvicorn python-multipart numpy keras
Setup
Clone the repository (if applicable): If you have this code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
Download the TensorFlow Lite Model: Ensure you have the model.tflite file. This file is crucial for the prediction. If you don't have it, you'll need to obtain or train a TensorFlow model and convert it to the TensorFlow Lite format. Place the model.tflite file in the same directory as BACKEND.py.
Usage
Run the FastAPI application:
uvicorn main:app --reload
This command starts the FastAPI server. The --reload flag enables automatic reloading of the server whenever you make changes to the code. By default, the server will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Access the API endpoint: The API provides a single endpoint for flower image prediction:
/predict/ (GET): Takes an image URL as a query parameter and returns the predicted flower type and confidence score.
To use the endpoint, send a GET request to /predict/ with the URL query parameter set to the URL of the image you want to classify. Example:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/?URL=https://example.com/flower.jpg
Replace https://example.com/flower.jpg with the actual URL of the image.
Example Response: The API will return a JSON response similar to the following:
"This image most likely belongs to sunflower with a 98.50 percent confidence."
Code Explanation
BACKEND.py
This file contains the IMG_PRED class, which handles the image prediction logic.

__init__: Initializes the class with the image height, width, model path, labels, and loads the TensorFlow Lite model. It also gets the signature runner for the model.
predict(url: str) -> str:
Takes an image URL as input.
Downloads the image from the URL using get_file.
Loads the image and resizes it to the specified dimensions.
Converts the image to a NumPy array.
Expands the dimensions of the array to match the expected input shape of the model.
Performs the prediction using the TensorFlow Lite model.
Applies the softmax function to the output to get the probabilities for each class.
Returns a string containing the predicted flower type and confidence score.
main.py
This file defines the FastAPI application.

FastAPI(): Creates a FastAPI application instance.
CORSMiddleware: Adds CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests. This is important if you are accessing the API from a different domain.
@app.post('/'): Defines a simple root endpoint that returns a message.
@app.get('/predict/'): Defines the /predict/ endpoint, which takes an image URL as a query parameter and returns the prediction result. It calls the predict method of the IMG_PRED class to perform the prediction. It also includes error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur during the prediction process.
Model Details
Model: The project uses a TensorFlow Lite model (model.tflite) for image classification.
Input Size: The model expects images of size 180x180 pixels.
Labels: The model is trained to classify images into the following flower types: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip.
Error Handling
The API includes basic error handling. If an error occurs during the prediction process, the API will return an error message indicating the cause of the error.

Deployment
This API can be deployed to various platforms, such as:

Heroku: A cloud platform that supports deploying Python applications.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): A suite of cloud computing services offered by Google.
Amazon Web Services (AWS): A suite of cloud computing services offered by Amazon.
Docker: A containerization platform that allows you to package the application and its dependencies into a container.
Future Improvements
Improve Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling to provide more informative error messages.
Add Input Validation: Validate the input URL to ensure that it is a valid image URL.
Implement Model Retraining: Implement a mechanism to retrain the model with new data to improve its accuracy.
Add More Flower Types: Train the model to classify more flower types.
Implement a User Interface: Create a user interface for uploading images and viewing the prediction results.
Add Logging: Implement logging to track API usage and errors.
Improve Performance: Optimize the code and model to improve performance.
